# joystickMouse
This project tries to create a Joystick-as-Mouse BLE HID device.

#
The hardware includes 1 Joystick + ESP32 module.

#
The software is made with Arduino & NimBLE bluetooth stack.
The libraries and inspiration projects I refered are:
1. [ESP32 NimBLE Mouse library](https://github.com/wakwak-koba/ESP32-NimBLE-Mouse)
2. [BLE Game Controller](https://github.com/palsayantan/BLE-Game-Controller)
